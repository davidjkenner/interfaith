Mark 12:29-33

The Greatest Commandment  
([Deuteronomy 6:1–19](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6.htm);  [Matthew 22:34–40](https://biblehub.com/matthew/22.htm#34))

 1. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.
 2. And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.
 
“Right, Rabbi,” the scribe replied. “You have stated correctly that God is One and there is no other but Him, and to love Him with all your heart and with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself, which is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.”

Matthew 19:16-21
The Rich Young Man  
([Mark 10:17–31](https://biblehub.com/mark/10.htm#17);  [Luke 18:18–30](https://biblehub.com/luke/18.htm#18))

Just then a man came up to Jesus and inquired, “Rabbi, what good thing must I do to obtain eternal life?”

“Why do you ask Me about what is good?” Jesus replied.  “There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.”
 “‘
 3. Do not murder, 
 4. do not commit adultery, 
 5. do not steal, 
 6. do not bear false witness, 
 7. honor your father and mother.

“All these I have kept,” said the young man. “What do I still lack?”

Jesus told him,  “If you want to be perfect, go, 
8. sell your possessions and 
9. give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. 
10. Then come, follow Me.”
