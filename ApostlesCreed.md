_Testamentum in Galilaea D[ominus]. N[oster]. I[esu]. Christi_ was written between 150 and 180. This formula states: "[I believe] in the Father almighty, – and in Jesus Christ, our Savior; – and in the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, in the holy Church, and in the remission of sins."


**Old Roman Symbol**
I believe in God the Father almighty;  
and in Christ Jesus His only Son, our Lord,  
Who was born of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary,  
Who under Pontius Pilate was crucified and buried,  
on the third day rose again from the dead,  
ascended to heaven,  
sits at the right hand of the Father,  
whence He will come to judge the living and the dead;  
and in the Holy Spirit,  
the holy Church,  
the remission of sins,  
the resurrection of the flesh  
(the life everlasting)

The Apostle's Creed has been used in the [Latin liturgical rites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_liturgical_rites "Latin liturgical rites") since the 8th century and, by extension, in the various modern branches of [Western Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Christianity "Western Christianity"), including the modern liturgy and [catechesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechesis "Catechesis") of the [Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church"), [Lutheranism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheranism "Lutheranism"), [Anglicanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicanism "Anglicanism"), [Presbyterianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterianism "Presbyterianism"), [Moravianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravian_Church "Moravian Church"), [Methodism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodism "Methodism"), and [Congregational churches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregational_church "Congregational church"). Also the Disciples of Christ and the American Baptist Convention

The Catholic Church still today uses an interrogative form of it in the Rite of Baptism (for both children and adults). In the official English translation ([ICEL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_on_English_in_the_Liturgy "International Commission on English in the Liturgy"), 1974) the minister of baptism asks:

> Do you believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth?  
> Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died, and was buried, rose from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?  
> Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?

To each question, the catechumen, or, in the case of an infant, the parents and  [sponsor(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponsor_(Christianity) "Sponsor (Christianity)")  (godparent(s)) in his or her place, answers "I do." Then the celebrant says:

> This is our faith. This is the faith of the Church. We are proud to profess it, in Christ Jesus our Lord.

The [Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian_Church_of_Aotearoa_New_Zealand "Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand") uses the Apostles' Creed in its baptism rite in spite of the reservations of some of its members regarding the phrase "born of the virgin Mary"

The [Episcopal Church in the United States of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America "Episcopal Church in the United States of America") uses the Apostles' Creed in an interrogative form at the [Easter Vigil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Vigil "Easter Vigil") in The Renewal of Baptismal Vows.

The _[Book of Common Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer "Book of Common Prayer")_ may also be used, which in its rite of baptism has the minister recite the Apostles' Creed in interrogative form. Asking the godparents or, in the case "of such as are of Riper Years", the candidate: "Dost thou believe in God the Father ..." The response is: "All this I stedfastly believe."

The [Church of Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Denmark "Church of Denmark") started using the phrase, from the [baptismal vows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptismal_vows "Baptismal vows") "We renounce the devil and all his doings and all his beings" as the beginning of this creed, before the line "We believe in God etc."

**Eucharistic rite**
Since the 2002 edition, the Apostles' Creed is included in the [Roman Missal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Missal "Roman Missal") as an alternative, with the indication, "Instead of the [Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed"), especially during Lent and Easter time, the baptismal Symbol of the Roman Church, known as the Apostles' Creed, may be used."

**Canonical hours**
The Apostles' Creed is used in  [Anglican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicanism "Anglicanism")  services of  [Matins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matins "Matins")  and  [Evening Prayer (Evensong)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evening_Prayer_(Anglican) "Evening Prayer (Anglican)"). It is invoked after the recitation or singing of the  [Canticles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canticle "Canticle"), and is the only part of the services in which the congregation traditionally turns to face the altar, if they are seated transversely in the  [quire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir_(architecture) "Choir (architecture)").

The Episcopal Church (United States) uses the Apostles' Creed in Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer.

Before the 1955 [simplification of the rubrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Roman_Calendar_of_Pope_Pius_XII "General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII") of the [Roman Breviary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Breviary "Roman Breviary") by [Pope Pius XII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_XII "Pope Pius XII"), the Apostles' Creed was recited at the beginning of [matins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matins "Matins") and [prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(liturgy) "Prime (liturgy)"), at the end of [compline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compline "Compline"), and in some _[preces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preces "Preces")_ (a series of [versicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versicle "Versicle") and responses preceded by, [eleison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleison "Eleison") ("Lord, have mercy") and the [Our Father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Father "Our Father")) of prime and compline

**Indulgence**
Recitation of the _Apostles' Creed_ or the _[Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed")_ is required to obtain a partial [indulgence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgence "Indulgence").

**Catechism**
In Luther's preface to his '[Small Catechism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther%27s_Small_Catechism "Luther's Small Catechism")' which makes up part of the [Book of Concord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Concord "Book of Concord") that contains the symbolical documents of the Lutheran Church, it is suggested to commit the Creed, along with the [Decalogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments "Ten Commandments") and [Lord's Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord%27s_Prayer "Lord's Prayer") to memory.

**Ecumenical (interdenominational) versions**
I believe in God, the Father almighty,  
creator of heaven and earth.  
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.  
He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit  
and born of the virgin Mary.  
He suffered under Pontius Pilate,  
was crucified, died, and was buried.  
He descended to the dead.  
On the third day he rose again.  
He ascended into heaven,  
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.  
He will come again to judge the living and the dead.  
I believe in the Holy Spirit,  
the holy catholic Church,  
the communion of the saints,  
the forgiveness of sins,  
the resurrection of the body,  
and the life everlasting. Amen.
